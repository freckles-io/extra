# Curated list of Ansible roles, frecklecutables and freckelize adapters

This repository contains a collection of [Ansible roles](http://ansible-docs.readthedocs.io/zh/stable-2.0/rst/playbooks_roles.html), [frecklecutables](https://docs.freckles.io/en/latest/frecklecute_command.html#frecklecutables) and [freckelize adapters](https://docs.freckles.io/en/latest/freckelize_command.html#adapters-profiles) which can be considered useful for a wider audience.

It is assembled using the [`git subtree` command](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/git/alternatives-to-git-submodule-git-subtree), which is why whoever contributes to this repository should try to avoid mixing commits that relate to several different (remote) git repositories.
